### Computational Science

We try to understand physical systems with computational and algorithmic
methods. As algorithms are eating the world, this approach will be more
widely used.


<!-- ### Machine Learning / Data Mining / Artificial Intelligence -->

<!-- These research arear are rising faster than people anticipated.  -->
<!-- Their application will make ways into many branches of our work and everyone of us will be affected. -->
<!-- There are a few things in particular we are interested: -->
<!-- - The techinques applied to computational science -->

<!-- ### Analysis -->

<!-- Analysis. -->
