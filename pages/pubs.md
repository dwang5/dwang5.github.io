### <a name="understanding"></a> Understanding and predicting 

#### SnTiO3

Perovskite SnTiO3 is well-known for hard to obtain. Until early this year (2018), it was not available (PRB, **97**, 054109).
We calculated the effective Hamiltonian coefficients for this material
and studied how its structural phases change with temperature -- the resutlts are not what we had expected ...

[![ArXiv](./icons16/pdf-icon.png)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00888v3)

#### CCTO

CCTO is -- since it is hard to guess its name -- quite complex.
One feature of CaCu3Ti4O12 is that it has large dielectric permittivity
near the room temperature. We analyze the participating dyanmic
processes that make it possible.
