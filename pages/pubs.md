#### SnTiO3

Perovskite SnTiO3 is well-known for hard to obtain. Until early this year (2018), it was not there (cite ...).
We calculated the effective Hamiltonian coefficients for this material
and studied how its structural phases change with temperature -- the resutlts are not what we had expected ...
