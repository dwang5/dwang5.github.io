### Computational Science

We try to understand physical systems with computational and algorithmic
approach.

### Intelligent methods
There is no doubt that  many people have noticed that algorithms are eating the world.  
This trend will inevitably enter our research area as well -- we
better embrace this new approach.

Roughly speaking, there are three common intelligent approaches:
- Data Minining.
  In this approach, researchers accumulate a large amount of data, and
  hope to find some better ones than currently used.

- Machine Learning.
  In some sense, this is a better way for data mining.

- Artificial Intelligence.
  With the advent of "Alpha Go" and "Alpha Go Zero", AI is taking over.
  This is a true game changer that everyone of us will be affected.
